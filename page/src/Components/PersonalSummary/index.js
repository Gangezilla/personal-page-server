        I&apos;m Scott. I really like dogs, and I think this is the best photo of me that&apos;s ever going to be taken.
        I&apos;m a front end (and aspiring full stack) developer whose currently working at Domain Group in Sydney, Australia. I&apos;m very interested in solving cool problems, teaching, and seeing the impact of awesome work. I do most of my work in React and Node; I really just love JS.
      </P>
      <P>
        I try and bring my design background to my development by trying to think like the people using my products, and working to create great products.

        You can check out some of the things I&apos;ve done below, or if you want a quick resume summary, you can grab that right here. Just a warning, this resume isn&apos;t usually as up to date as the rest of this page, but I do my best to update it when I can.
      </P>
      <Resume
        target="_blank"
        // href={resume}

       Resume
      </Resume>
    </InnerPersonalSummary>
  </PersonalSummaryContainer>
