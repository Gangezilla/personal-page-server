In the end, I was really happy with how it turned out and I suppose so were the people I work with at Domain. There\'s a lot of things in here that I\'d do differently now (such as all the webpack config, and the overly verbose Redux when it probably should be plain old React) but it is indicative of where I was at the time and is great to look back on and see how I\'ve grown since.',

This was a really cool project actually, because it allowed me to really start thinking about how information gets from place to place. JSON is a really great way to do this, and it even partially inspired how I'm building this website right now. Since doing this project, I was able to think more critically about our back end at work, and how to shuttle information into the front end. It's all just text, right?",

I remember there was this moment where I realised that API calls, unlike everything else I had done up to this point in time, could be asynchronous, and that my second call just might not be getting the information from the first one in time. Quite a good realisation to make.",
